# Unsplash image App

This app integrates with the Unsplash api to recieve images based on queries.
This app can ofcourse scale which means tools like typescript , sass etc can be intergrated in it for better maintainability
of the app. Given the limited time this is ofcourse the minimum version and ofcourse new
features can be easily added and maintained.

## Challenges faced

Being honest choosing right design is the biggest Challenge given the
limited amount of time. Other than that the app uses a custom hook for
api call and this custom hook controls the whole flow of data in the app.
Reading docs of different things like Unsplash api , ant design etc also
consumes a significant amount of time.
